cd Extended-Exchange-Crypto-Trading-Bot-Code---Examples
```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit `.env` with your Extended Exchange credentials

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Environment Variables (.env)

**IMPORTANT:** All Extended Exchange API variables MUST start with `X10_` prefix:

```env
# Required - Get these from Extended Exchange
X10_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
X10_PRIVATE_KEY=your_stark_private_key_here  
X10_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stark_public_key_here
X10_VAULT_ID=your_vault_id_here

# Optional - Defaults shown
X10_BASE_URL=https://api.extended.exchange
EXTENDED_WS_HOST=wss://api.extended.exchange
EXTENDED_SYMBOL=BTC-USD
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The `X10_` prefix is required for all API-related environment variables. This is a quirk of the Extended Exchange SDK.

### Bot Settings

Edit these constants at the top of `trading_bot.py`:

```python
POSITION_SIZE_USD = 100  # Position size in USD
TAKE_PROFIT = 2.0        # Take profit at 2% gain
STOP_LOSS = -1.0         # Stop loss at 1% loss
LOOP_SLEEP = 2           # Sleep between loops (seconds)
```

## Usage üéÆ

Run the bot:
```bash
python trading_bot.py
```

### Trading Flow

   - Loops until filled
   - Adjusts size for partial fills
